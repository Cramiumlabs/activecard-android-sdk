# t-of-n MPC Overview

# Prerequisite

*   Each party can only join one active session at a time
    *   If a party joins a session, they cannot initiate or join other sessions
*   **Party A** is designated as the **initializer** and holds the mnemonic phrase at the first time
    *   All members can be an initializer
    *   Only initializers can start a session
*   **Party C** is another Party member as **Mobile**, **Browser Extension**, or etc.
*   User can make multiple MPC groups
    *   Example scenarios for User A:
        *   Wallet 1: Members - A, B, C
        *   Wallet 2: Members - A, B, D
        *   Wallet 3: Members - A, B
*   Each process checks the HW device is paired
*   Trusted server model assumption: All parties send messages to Cloud server which is as relay server. All parties use AES encryption with ECDH key exchange and encrypt messages using server's public key. Server decrypts messages and send them with encryption using final recipient's public key.

# What members are needed for

| **All members** | Adding member | Removing member | Creating new wallet |
| ---| ---| ---| --- |
| Only **threshold** members | Signing | Exporting |  |

# Discussion

*   **Special master role :** Select a master and only master can initialize requesting process or exporting a secret
*   **Offline process for 2-of-2(3) with HW** : If threshold is 2 and user have a HW device, user doesn't need to access our infrastructure (but to send tx to blockchain, user still need to access internet). If we can skip user's authentication, user can send tx without our infrastructure.
    *   this can be solution about key export when our infra is down

# Adding new member

### Party A side

1. **Party A** : Fetch shards from Cloud and request transaction
    1. If the user has already removed the server's shard then skip fetching server shard.
2. **Party A** : Send MPC key resharing request
    1. Send MPC key resharing request with Cloud's shard and session ID
    2. Send session ID to other parties
        1. Session ID is from Auth server
            1. Auth server generates session ID as uuidv4
            2. Auth server saves session ID
            3. Auth server sends session ID to user device
        2. Send session ID to all parties includes a new party

            2. share button or copy session ID
            3. Send QR code or session ID to user securely
    3. User waits all parties will be joined
        1. Show parties list that are currently joined
3. **(If HW device exist) Mobile SDK :** Send MPC key resharing request to HW device with session ID
4. **(If HW device exist) HW device** : HW device sends join session request to Mobile SDK
    1. Mobile SDK forwards HW device's request to cloud server
5. **Server** : Gets Cloud SEK and decrypt Cloud's shard
6. **All** : Run rounds of Key sharing
    1. rounds will start after session is started
7. **All** : Saving new shards

            1. There is a join a group button along with the sign-in button at the beginning, and when pressed, **the adding process proceeds without creating a wallet after registering with the auth server for the first time.**
            2. After registering, show a join page with scan QR code button or input session ID button
                1. If new party scans QR code or input session ID, then join the the session
    2. New party is already registered in our app (optional)
        1. Press wallet setting button

### Implementation Challenges (optional)

*       *   Allow all parties to create a new wallet(mnemonic)
        *   Or allow only master user to create a new wallet
*       *   Creating a new shard without changing original shards
        *   Note: Web3Auth supports multiple backup key generation
        *   User can choose between:
            *   Modifying threshold : all members shards will be changed
            *   Adding new member (with optional server removal) : all members shards will be changed
            *   Adding member only : only new partyâs shard will be created
        *   tss-lib, core-lib implementation needed
*       *   If a user has more shards than the threshold, user can delete the server's shards
        *   example : If 2-of-2 wallets and user add a new party, then user can delete server's shard and keep user's wallet 2-of-2.
